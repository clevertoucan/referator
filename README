This is a developmental framework for an app that will enable a user to fetch videos from YouTube and trim the video down to a 1-30 second snippet. These snippets will be stored on the devidce to allow for rapid use. The intention is for users to be able to make referencs to videos they find amusing. 

The app will be deployed on Android; if successful I might get around to learning C# and makingit for iOS too. Currently, the project is still in the very, very, very early stages ofdevelopment, I'm currently toying around with the YouTube API and looking around for a auitableYoutube rip site that has a good API.
